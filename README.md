# odin-landing-page
Recreating landing page provided by The Odin Project
    Using HTMl and CSS to recreate website
    This time using CSS Flexbox in order to organize and style items
    Biggest challenge was getting used to using divs in order to seperate the different containers and items
    Using the right flex direction to get the right order and trying to get text to wrap a certain way while keeping the content the right size
    Used Ipad with ipad pencil to better visualize how to seperate items into containers
    Getting used to trying to use padding as well as align content/items
